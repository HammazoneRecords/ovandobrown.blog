# The Book of Solobility — Portal

A MindwaveJA project by Ovando Brown.

**Live:** [whatissolob.com](https://whatissolob.com)

The digital portal for *The Book of Solobility V0* — a reader experience built around the 8 Jhanos Gates of the Solobic framework. Users enter through their gate, receive a forged copy of the book, and read it in a cinematic PDF reader with chapter navigation.

## Architecture

| Layer | Detail |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React SPA — Threshold → Gate Selection → Offering → Confirmation → Reader |
| Backend | Express server (`server.ts`) handling API routes + static serving |
| Database | `solobility.db` — SQLite with `purchases` and `reader_analytics` tables |
| PDF Reader | PDF.js with chapter manifest (`src/data/volume0-manifest.json`) |
| Analytics | Silent 30s heartbeat tracking page progress and reading time |
